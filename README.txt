Hello! Welcome to Gamr.

Our project is a social media experience for people who are interested in video games. The web app is focused on bringing people together based on their common interests in video games. 

Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, people are turning to virtual alternatives for social interaction. With social distancing practices in place, video games are a favorable method of social interaction - but it can be difficult to find people that share interest in the same games. With Gamr, we want to make it easy for people all over the world to make meaningful connections over video games - even if they canâ€™t meet in person.
